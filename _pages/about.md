## <span style="color:#3498db;">Quantum phase transitions in a Dicke trimer with both photon and atom hoppings</span>
We investigate superradiant quantum phase transitions in a Dicke trimer model consisting of two types of hoppings, i.e., photon hoppings and atom hoppings. In the superradiant regime, the system can exist in two distinct phases: normal and frustrated superradiant phases, which are governed by both types of hoppings. Particularly, the interplay between these hoppings gives rise to interesting effects, such as triggering superradiance with much lower coupling strengths when both hoppings exhibit the same tendency. In contrast, with opposite tendencies, the competition between hoppings leads to a first-order phase transition between two different superradiant phases with translational symmetry broken. These findings enable the system to undergo a sequence of transitions across three phases by changing the coupling strength. Our work provides deep insights into competing interactions and quantum phase transitions in multi-cavity systems with geometric structures.

## <span style="color:#3498db;">High-fidelity universal quantum gates for hybrid systems via the practical photon scattering
hybrid systems via the practical photon scattering</span>
High-fidelity quantum logic gates are essential in quantum computation, and both photons and electron spins in quantum dots (QDs) have their own unique advantages in implementing quantum computation. It is of critical significance to achieve high-fidelity quantum gates for photon-QD hybrid systems. Here, we propose two schemes for implementing high-fidelity universal quantum gates including Toffoli gate and Fredkin gate for photon-QD hybrid systems, utilizing the practical scattering of a single photon off a QD-cavity system. The computation errors from the imperfections involved in the practical scattering are detected and prevented from arising in the final results of the two gates. Accordingly, the unity fidelity of each quantum gate is obtained in the nearly realistic condition, and the requirement for experimental realization is relaxed. Furthermore, the quantum circuits for the two gates are compact and no auxiliary qubits are required, which would also be the advantages regarding their experimental feasibility. These features indicate that our schemes may be useful in the practical quantum computation tasks.
